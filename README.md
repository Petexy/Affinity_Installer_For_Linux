## Troubleshooting:
- The app is fully written in Python. For some reason sometimes it fails to perform step 2 (executing wine-affinity-config.sh) if the "affinity-installer" is not in the /usr/bin directory. If that happens, you will need to move the script to the /usr/bin/ directory for it to work properly
- The app requires some dependencies: python-gobject, gtk4, libadwaita, python - Those are required to use the application. Be sure you have them installed if you use it on Arch-based other than Linexin.
